Talkomatic is an online platform for real-time text communication, essentially a modern reimagining of the classic chat room experience. Users can type messages, and everyone in the room can see the messages as they are being typed, creating a unique and engaging chat experience.

**Check out the website here:** [open.talkomatic.co](https://open.talkomatic.co)

## Features

- **Real-time Chat**: See messages as they're being typed, not just after they're sent.
- **Multiple Room Types**: Create public, semi-private (with access code), or private rooms.
- **Flexible Layout**: Choose between horizontal or vertical room layouts.
- **User Presence**: See who's in the room and their locations.
- **Invite System**: Easily invite others to your chat room with a generated link.
- **Sound Notifications**: Audible cues when users join or leave the room.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on any device.
